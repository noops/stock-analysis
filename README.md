# stock-analysis
Used VBA to analyze a spreadsheet containing thousands of rows of stock market data. created arrays to hold the total volume, starting price, ending price, and various stock tickers. Used a tickerIndex variable to assign data to array indexes corresponding to the correct ticker. Initially used nested for loops, but those were replaced with arrays and separate for loops to increase run time. This macro should hopefully be able to be used on any spreadsheet containing stock market data formatted the same way as the spreadsheets analyzed here. Having trouble with the return column. Can't figure out why it only outputs the first return value and then outputs everything else as -100%
